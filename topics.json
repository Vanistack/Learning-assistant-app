    "summary": "Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI focused on the use of algorithms that can learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. It encompasses supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms. Core methods include regression, classification, clustering, and model evaluation metrics. Understanding the trade-offs between bias and variance, overfitting, and model generalization is key for applying ML in production settings.",
